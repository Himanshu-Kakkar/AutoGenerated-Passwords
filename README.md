I learnt how can we generate random numbers using rand() and srand() functions in c++. 

to use rand() and srand() function we have to include cstdlib header file and ctime.h for time(0) function.

rand() function starting index is 1 by default.

multiple rand() functions can give random order but at time to multiple exectuion the order will same because of starting index thats why we use srand() function.

srand(time(0)) function is used to change the starting index for rand() function with respect to time at every nanosecond.
